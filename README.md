# fcc-random-quote-machine
This is a Random Quote Machine project made for the Front End Development Libraries certification through freeCodeCamp.org

Made with: React and Next.js 

(Next with redux is way too complex for a small project like this, so I dropped. But I kept the files for future reference on redux implementation, mostly on nextless react apps).

*Currently being deployed at [Netlify](https://elastic-agnesi-c2d665.netlify.app/)*
